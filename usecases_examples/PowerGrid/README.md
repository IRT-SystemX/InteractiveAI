# PowerGrid grid2op POC simulator

This POC use Grid2Op platform to perform it simulation.

Grid2Op is a platform, built with modularity in mind, that allows to perform powergrid operation.
And that's what it stands for: Grid To Operate.
Grid2Op acts as a replacement of [pypownet](https://github.com/MarvinLer/pypownet) 
as a library used for the Learning To Run Power Network [L2RPN](https://l2rpn.chalearn.org/). 

This framework allows to perform most kind of powergrid operations, from modifying the setpoint of generators,
to load shedding, performing maintenance operations or modifying the *topology* of a powergrid
to solve security issues.

For further explanation on Grid2Op, the official documentation of Grid2Op is available at [https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/).
And it can also be found here [Grid2Op/README.md](Grid2Op/README.md).

# 1 Installation
## 1.1 Requirements:
* Python >= 3.6
* Docker and Docker Compose

## 1.2 Setup a Virtualenv (optional)
Follow this section in case you are working on localhost, and without Docker.

### Create a virtual environment 
```commandline
cd usecases_examples/PowerGrid
python3 -m venv venv_grid2op
```

### Enter the virtual environment
```commandline
source venv_grid2op/scripts/activate
```

## 1.3 Installation of the simulator layer
Either use CASE 1 or CASE 2 to install the PowerGrid's simulator of your choice.


### 1.3.1 CASE 1 : Console Simulator

1. Install dependencies for the console simulator (optional, yet required when working on localhost):

```commandline
cd InteractiveAI/usecases_examples/PowerGrid
pip install -r requirements-consol.txt
```

2. Launch the InteractiveAI event listener server, compatible with the console simulator.

```commandline
docker compose up -d --build api
```

The launched API might be accessible at this address: 
http://SERVER_ADDRESS:5100

The SERVER_ADDRESS will be the one of the computer used to launch the Docker command.

### 1.3.2 CASE 2 : Web App Simulator

1. Install dependencies for the console simulator (optional, yet required when working on localhost):

```commandline
cd InteractiveAI/usecases_examples/PowerGrid
pip install -r requirements-app.txt
```

**2. Launch the whole all in one web app simulator through docker on a computer (BEST APPROACH):** 

```commandline
docker compose up -d --build app
```

The launched app might be accessible at this address: 
http://SERVER_ADDRESS:5100/

The SERVER_ADDRESS will be the one of the computer used to launch the Docker command.

# 2 Run the simulator

## 2.1 CASE 1 : Console Simulator

### Configurate the simulator settings
* Define your simulation configuration in the file: [`/InteractiveAI/usecases_examples/PowerGrid/config/CONFIG.toml`](/usecases_examples/PowerGrid/config/CONFIG.toml)
* Define InteractiveAI connection settings in the file: [`/InteractiveAI/usecases_examples/PowerGrid/config/API_POWERGRID_CAB.toml`](/usecases_examples/PowerGrid/config/API_POWERGRID_CAB.toml)

### Run the simulator in your terminal
```commandline
cd InteractiveAI/usecases_examples/PowerGrid
python PowerGrid_poc_simulator_consol.py
```

## 2.2 CASE 2 : Web App Simulator

### To launch the simulator app (BEST APPROACH)
Open a web browser and navigate to the URL returned by Docker after running the containers. 
This URL will typically be `http://localhost:5100/` unless you've configured a different port.

Note: If you're running Docker on a remote machine or using Docker Toolbox on Windows, 
you may need to replace 'localhost' with the appropriate IP address.
For example : http://SERVER_ADDRESS:5100/  with **SERVER_ADDRESS** the one of your remote machine.

### Run the simulator in your terminal (optional)
```commandline
cd InteractiveAI/usecases_examples/PowerGrid
python PowerGrid_poc_simulator_app.py
```

## 2.3 Credentials required to run any simulator

To run the simulation, you will need the following credentials:

**InteractiveAI credentials:**
   - Username: `publisher_test`
   - Password: `test`

These credentials are created by the InteractiveAI platform. The PowerGrid's simulator only requests access to the InteractiveAI platform server using these credentials.
